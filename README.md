# Sudoku CLI

**Sudoku CLI** is a text-based Sudoku game written in C. The program allows the user to play Sudoku of various sizes and difficulty levels without the need for a graphical interface.

## 🧩 Features

- Board sizes: `4x4`, `9x9`, `16x16`
- Three difficulty levels:
  - Easy (more hints)
  - Medium
  - Hard (fewer hints)
- Text-based interface (terminal)
- Random board generation for each game
- Save and load game state
- Validate solution correctness
- Game timer empty and cell counter
- Built-in help/instructions
- Error handling and input validation

## 🛠️ Compilation (Windows, with MinGW)

You’ll need a C compiler (e.g. `gcc`). Make sure the `sudoku.h` header file is in the same directory. Open `cmd` or another terminal, navigate to the game folder, and run:

```bash
gcc main.c sasolver.c sudokuMenu.c GA/GA.c GA/GAinterface.c GA/crossovers.c GA/mutations.c GA/selections.c -o sudoku.exe

sudoku.exe
```


## 📋 Controls
1. Start a new game or load a previously saved one.
2. Choose the board size and difficulty level.
3. Use the game menu to:
   -  Make a move (enter row, column, and value separated by spaces)
   -  Save the game
   -  Show instructions
   -  Solve the board using Simulated Annealing
   -  Solve the board using Genetic Algorithm
4. To clear a cell, enter `0` as the value.
5. Some cells (hints) are locked and cannot be modified.

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations
- No validation for unique Sudoku solutions (a generated puzzle may have more than one valid solution).
- No undo feature (you can overwrite a move or clear it by entering 0, but you can't revert it directly).
- The implementation uses pre-defined base boards with permutations rather than:
  - A proper backtracking algorithm for generation
  - Validation of solution uniqueness after digit removal
